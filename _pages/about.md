I am a first-year PhD student majoring in Computer Science at The University of Arizona, advised by [Dr. Eduardo Blanco](https://eduardoblanco.github.io/). My research interests are broadly in the area of Natural Language Processing. In specific, I am currently working on question answering in human dialogue.

* I am transferring to The University of Arizona as a PhD student still.
