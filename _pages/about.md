I am a fourth-year PhD candidate majoring in Computer Science at the University of Arizona, advised by [Dr. Eduardo Blanco](https://eduardoblanco.github.io/). I am a member of [Computational Language Understanding (CLU) Lab](https://clulab.org/).  
 My research interests are broadly in the area of Natural Language Understanding, including Question Answering and LLM reasoning. Please refer to my publication list for my recent works.

* Question Answering: I am interested in all kinds of questions that are asked by real humans---realizing that real human questions are much more interesting (and more challenging)! As an example, I have been worked on understanding indirect answers to yes-no questions in dialogue---people do not like to say *yes* or *no* to those questions.
* LLMs: I am interested in exploring LLMs' ability (as well as weakness) on question answering tasks, or reasoning tasks, since answering questions involves all sorts of reasoning process.
